# Input

This React Native app does not take external user input such as touch or text entry. Instead, the input is hardcoded within the program. 
Specifically, the values entered by include the user’s name, degree program, and school. These values are set as static text within three "Text" components in the app.

# Process

The app uses TypeScript in a React Native environment and runs through Expo. The logic of the app lies in rendering UI components. The app uses one "View" as the main container, three `Text` components to display static content, and one "StyleSheet" to style the layout. The "View" organizes the structure, and the styling includes a yellow background and centered alignment using Flexbox.

# Output

The output is a mobile screen that displays three lines of text: the user’s name, degree program, and school. The text appears centered on a yellow background.
